### What I learned

I learned about apis and dealin with them especially with promises. I had alot of time understanding api and their functioning. I must say that time spent was well work and promise in javascript is just a heaven for a web developer. It makes accessing data easier and thus we can transfer data within file and backend server.


### Continued development
My future development will be based totally on back-end. But eventually I would also focus on front-end and styling side as I see I need to learn about the frameworks of both javascript such as React and CSS such as Tailwind CSS
